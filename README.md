# :fork_and_knife: Reasy: Reservation Made Easy 
Mission: Dreading peak lunch hours at the CBD? This was created to allow advanced reservation of seats in restaurants AND also advanced orders of meals. This will allow the restaurant to serve you your meal right on your arrival time. No time wasted because you had to wait!

## :paperclip: What is Reasy?
Reasy was a group collaboration class project together with <a href="https://www.github.com/claraonmars">claraonmars</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/wang0805">wang0805</a>. We decided on this idea because we felt that refuelling via meals is integral to human survival and everyone should be able to refuel without the stress of trying to have a meal under tight timings and thronging crowds.

<b>Ruby on Rails</b> was used to develop this application.
